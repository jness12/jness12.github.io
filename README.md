This is a page where I'll share some information about myself and the work I am doing in BioInformatics. So far, I've done some work to analyze data on Penguins, and I've also done some work with the Great Lake's Fish data..

##Work with Penguins Data

I started learning hoe to use R by working with the Palmer Penguins data set. We ran an analysis using a small subset of 44 penguins. If you are interested, you can see my analysis [here](https://agmath.github.io/BioStatisticsAnalysis/Penguin.html)
