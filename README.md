# Jennessa's BioAnalysis
This is a page where I'll share some information about myself and the work I am doing in BioInformatics. So far, I've done some work to analyze data on Penguins, and I've also done some work with the Great Lake's Fish data. More recently, I have worked on finding the Origin of replication using a genome, as well as some w

# About Me
I am a biology major at Southern New Hampshire University and expect to graudate in 2024. This past semester I been apart of the club field hockey team, and have been working two part-time jobs at the CMC Hospital as a dietary aide associate and recently as a pharmacy technician at Walgreens.

While at SNHU, Ive had the opportunity to strengthen my time mangement skills and learn the importance of responsibility. Some strengths of mine include discipline, versatility and harmony, as I like to stay organized and I get along well with everyone.

# Work with Penguins Data

I started learning how to use R by working with the Palmer Penguins data set. We ran an analysis using a small subset of 44 penguins. If you are interested, you can see my analysis [here](https://jness12.github.io/BioStatisticsAnalysis/penguin.html)

# Work with Great Lakes Fish

Here I worked with larger data and observed 51 fish species among the Great Lakes. The data I used is from Great Lakes Fishery Commission and was collected as early as 1867. If you are interested, you can see my analysis [here](https://jness12.github.io/BioStatisticsAnalysis/Fishdata.html)

# Origin of Replication

The origin of replication consists of 3 parts in which we built code to locate specific patterns in the genome to help us find the orgin. We worked with a randomly generated genome and used it to build multiple functions to help locate the origin of replication [here](https://agmath.github.io/BIO4ST1_Group1/Replication_Jennessa_Brunette.html)

# Work with Volcano Data
Here I worked with volcano data that was researched by the Smithsonian Instution. This research had a lot of data, so I split the data to work with a smaller subset. This work can be looked at [here](https://agmath.github.io/BIO4ST1_Group1/Volcano.nb.html)
