# Jennessa's BioAnalysis
This is a page where I'll share some information about myself and the work I am doing in BioInformatics. So far, I've done some work to analyze data on Penguins, and I've also done some work with the Great Lake's Fish data.

# Work with Penguins Data

I started learning how to use R by working with the Palmer Penguins data set. We ran an analysis using a small subset of 44 penguins. If you are interested, you can see my analysis [here](https://jness12.github.io/BioStatisticsAnalysis/penguin.html)

# Work with Great Lakes Fish

Here I worked with larger data and observed 51 fish species among the Great Lakes. The data I used is from Great Lakes Fishery Commission and was collected as early as 1867. If you are interested, you can see my analysis [here](https://jness12.github.io/BioStatisticsAnalysis/Fish-data.html)
